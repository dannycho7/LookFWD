#LookFWD

##LookFWD is a chrome extension that solves procrastination! 
We've all been there. Two days before a midterm, you motivate yourself to studying the rest of the day, and somehow you end up browsing random youtube videos or scrolling endlessly through meaningless text on Facebook news feed. We're students too, we get it. LookFWD was originally inspired by my efforts to prevent this type of procrastination. I dedicated to logging out of Facebook before I exit out of the app, and before I knew it I was only logging in to Facebook once or twice a day. <br/>
It seems that periodical reminders to stay on task can indeed put you back on task. LookFWD aims to put you back on task. By consistently asking you if watching an Entertainment video is the best choice 12 hours before a midterm, we hope to reduce procrastination, even if by a little bit. LookFWD will give warnings based on the category/metadata of the content being loaded. <br/>
We can solve procrastination together!

3. Scraped Youtube and Facebook to hide comments on both platforms and videos on youtube based on categories<br/>
4. Provide inspirational quotes throughout the blocking of information<br/>
5. Analytic data provided for user visits via Chrome.storage API and Chart.js API<br/>
