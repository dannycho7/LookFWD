#Productivity InFocus - Preventing you from yourself

##Productivity InFocus is a chrome extension that prevents procrastination!
There I was, walking to my desk and ready to get some work done. I go on my laptop and open up tabs to facebook, youtube and gmail. The usual suspects. You can  predict what happened next.

We've all been there. Two days before a deadline, you motivate yourself to work the rest of the day. And somehow you end up watching DIY cooking videos, one after another and scrolling endlessly through your Facebook newsfeed. As students, we know this situation all too well.

LookFWD was originally inspired by my efforts to prevent this type of procrastination. At the start of the winter break, I dedicated myself to logging out of Facebook prior to closing the browser, and before I knew it I was only logging back on to Facebook once or twice a day to check messages. <br/>

It seems that periodical reminders to stay on task can keep you in focus. By consistently asking you if watching an Entertainment video is the best choice 12 hours before a midterm, LookFWD aims to reduce procrastination, even if by a little bit. LookFWD will give warnings based on the category and metadata of the content being loaded by the browser and provide analytics based on the amount of time spent on non-educational videos<br/>

Productivity InFocus will be your buddy looking out for you when you get off task. It reminds you before you start watching Youtube videos that aren’t educational related or when you’re on Facebook.<br/>

It works like this. We temporarily block the content you’re about to view as a reminder. You can then choose to view the content or go back to staying on task. Keep in mind you’re not blocked from using these sites, Productivity Infocus is just here to keep you from watching DIY cooking videos at 3am or whatever distraction you prefer.<br/>

Not only that, but we remove the stupid thumbnails on Youtube that content creators use to distract you! You can now stay focused even if you’re on Youtube.<br/>

At the end of the day, you can view your progress in a nice visual chart and keep yourself in focus.<br/>

We can prevent procrastination together!
